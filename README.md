An agency's demographic breakdown is compared to that of NYC's working population. Euclidean distance is used, a smaller score (close to 0) means an agency's demographic breakdown is 'closer in distance' or matches that of NYC's, while a larger score (close to 100) means 'farther in distance', doesn't match.
